## 01 - Static Website Provisioning with AWS
This project demonstrates how to provision resources for a static website using AWS services such as Route 53, CloudFront, Lambda@Edge, and S3. The goal is to create a highly available, scalable, and secure static website hosted on AWS. This project serves as a portfolio to showcase my knowledge and skills in AWS infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform.
