## 01 - Static Website Provisioning with Azure
This project demonstrates how to provision resources for a static website using Azure services such as Azure Front Door, Storage Account, Frontend Endpoint and Route Engine. The goal is to create a highly available, scalable, and secure static website hosted on Azure. This project serves as a portfolio to showcase my knowledge and skills in Azure infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform.
